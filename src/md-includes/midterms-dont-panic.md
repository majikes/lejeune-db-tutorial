I recommend that you have several pieces of scrap paper to doodle notes
on during the exam.
I *strongly* recommend you read the whole exam and begin with questions you
know how to solve quickly.
Some questions will be harder or take longer than others; 
don't spend all your time on one question worth only a few points! 


Consider this midterm **closed book**.   
You can **NOT** reference other online homeworks, worksheets, etc.  
You can use your notes or other things printed out.
They should be on paper as you may not switch screens after starting the exam.

You **MAY NOT** Google for anything,
You **MAY NOT** leave this website,
you **MAY NOT** visit any websites,
and you **MAY NOT** copy from a friend.
Do not paste information into your midterm unless you know it came from your midterm.
You **MAY NOT** receive help from anyone.

If you do not know the origin of material you should not paste it into this exam.
All material pasted into this exam must originate from this exam.
This implies, but is not limited to, copying from previous assignments,
copying from text messages, 
or copying from **any** website.

You **MUST** use the Google Chrome browser.

The instruction team will **not** answer questions about course content, SQL syntax, etc.
We will only deal with issues related to exam implementation.

If your browser hangs, for example because of a bad SQL query, simply kill the page and refresh.
It _should_ restore all your work even if it doesn't re-evaluate all answers, color-highlight boxes, etc.

You may **NOT** leave the classroom before you submit your exam.
When you submit your exam you <font color='red'>must enter the code </font>displayed on the screen at the front of the class
or given to you by ARS.`

You **must not** use your computer or phone in the classroom after you submit your exam.
After submitting your exam, simply leave the classroom or ARS.
