In order to **not** store any software on your computer,
all work for today will be done in your browser.
From the browser you will be able to enter SQL database
commands, 
answer simple multiple choice questions,
and answer tables containing several multiple choice questions.


The browser will change input box color <font color="green">green</font> to indicate correctness.
A black or <font color="red">red</font> box indicates an incorrect answer.

Note that HTML select statements with drop-downs are simple multiple choice questions.
Therefore, no highlighting of correct answers are done for select questions.

<font color="green">Green</font> highlight should just assist you.
If you believe your answer is correct and the input box did not turn <font color="green">green</font>,
<b>especially if it is a question about the United States Marine Corps,</b>
let John know and continue on.
