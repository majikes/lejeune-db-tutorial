Hi, well, welcome to Camp 421 databases and files. In this class, you'll be learning databases,
file storage, system structures and in their design. This is the first time teaching COMP421.

It used to be COMP521 and the plan is that it should be very, very similar to COMP521.
We will be coding in Python, which was the process, I think, in the last two semesters.
The programs are going to be very small and the syllabus has a recommendation for downloading Python and learning how to code in it.  But hopefully that will be very trivial for you.

So a little bit about myself, I am one of the newer faculty here at UNC Computer Science.

I've spent about 35 years in industry and worked for large corporations and startups.
I've been responsible for hundreds of millions of dollars of annual revenue.
And I've had 100+ developers reporting to me and I'd be responsible for tens of thousands of lines of code.

Late in my career, I decided to go back and get my Ph.D. and now I have my dream job.

So stop by my office sometime, introduce yourself and we'll talk about databases or whatever.
But welcome to databases!
