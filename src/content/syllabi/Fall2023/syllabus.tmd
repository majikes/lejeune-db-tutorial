#### {{!linkable_header('About me')}}

A little bit about me:
I worked in industry for 35+ years and pursued my PhD late in life.
I worked at IBM, Oracle, and a startup (see my [cv](#https://www.cs.unc.edu/~jmajikes/cv.htm)).
I've worked as a dishwasher, cop, and have been a USA Olympic cycling coach.
Ask me about meeting the Grateful Dead's [Jerry Garcia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Garcia) backstage;
not allowing [Graham Nash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Nash) into his own concert;
or cycling in a charity event with Tour de France cyclist [George Hincapie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hincapie).
Ask me about riding my bike from Raleigh to Richmond, from Boone to Lillington, across parts of Arizona, California, Montana, Maryland, Nevada or 100 miles out-and-back in Death Valley!


I got my PhD out of an interest in, and got to work on the development of, the [Artificial Pancreas](https://newsroom.uvahealth.com/2020/01/02/fda-approves-uva-developed-artificial-pancreas/).
Ask me how I worked at IBM but yet was able to be at the table when the FDA, NIH, and JDRF kicked off the research 
resulting in the [Medtronic 670G](https://www.jdrf.org/press-releases/jdrf-celebrates-fda-approval-of-artificial-pancreas-system/).
My actual PhD was in [computers training dogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccilNPMIXKE) out of the hopes of creating a harness that would train Diabetic Alert Dogs.
That research seems a long time ago.

My teaching computer science is based on the idea that students learn best when given
opportunities to practice-and-try.
Reading a book is required, but nothing replaces the hands-on struggle of learning a language by applying what you learn.
Learning a computer language is no different than learning a foreign language;
read the book but the results come from struggling and applying the information learned.

A [welcome video]({{get_url('panopto', hexcode=welcome_video_hexcode)}}) is available
and a worksheet bonus given for watching the video **before** 8:00 AM the first day of classes.

## {{!linkable_header('Course learning objectives')}}

<!-- taken from SIGCse Data Management https://csed.acm.org/knowledge-areas-data-management-dm-sigcse-2022-version/ -->

COMP 421 does not teach how to build a database management system (DBMS)!
It teaches how to use a DBMS and how a DBMS works.


Modular learning objectives:  
 - Use relational algebra to describe the relationship between database tables  
 - Build on your relational algebra skills to construct Structured Query Language (SQL) commands to create, insert, update, and retrieve data in a relational database  
 - Model enterprise data using E-R models, relational model, and normalization theory to create an database  
 - Analyze, create and differentiate between the use of indices (B$^+$-trees and hashes)  
 - Use your knowledge of indices to efficiently sort and join relations  
 - Use your understanding of the E-R model, relational model, and normalization theory to create an efficient database


The material covered in COMP 421 can be broken into three areas of emphasis. The first area includes database foundation material such as the relational model, relational algebra, and E-R model. The second area of emphasis is database application programming and includes among others the topics of Structured Query Language (SQL), integrating databases into programs, web-based database usage, and active databases. The third area of emphasis is the systems side of databases, which includes database indexing, efficient query evaluation, the transaction-based model, concurrency, and security.

COMP 421 also reinforces skills that were learned in early CS classes.
One of those skills is the _iterative development and debugging_ process.
In this course, do **not** expect to immediately code a long SQL query,
get an unexpected response,
and understand what went wrong!
Do **not** fill out an entire B+ Tree, get an error, and expect to understand what is wrong!
You must iteratively develop answers, test their validity, and move to more complex solutions.

This secondary or tertiary skill of iterative development and debugging
is key in most technical skills development.

## {{!linkable_header('Target Audience')}}

## {{!linkable_header('Course Assignments')}}

### {{!linkable_header('Technology')}}

We will use web-based, Chrome, software for all in-class assignments.
Using Safari or other web-based browsers have been shown to have incompatibilities.
The first worksheet, [a demo worksheet]({{get_url('worksheets', key='worksheet-00-demo')}}), is available for you to play with.
It will be due before the end of the first week of class.
If you complete the worksheet demo **before** 8:00 AM the first day of class, you will receive a [worksheet bonus](#worksheet-bonus).

Note, that the browser-based assessments have some security and safety features built-in.
Do **NOT** copy/paste answers to your friends, from an external website or any other non-class source as this is a violation of the [Honor Code](#honor-code).
You are encouraged to collaborate with others on non-exams but your work must be typed in by yourself.

Since your first submission has the largest weight and for some assessments, only the first submission will be accepted, a safety feature is installed to prevent inadvertent submissions.
(See the section on [subsequent submissions](#subsequent-submissions) for more information.)
There is a pledge at the bottom of each submission near the submit button.
Until you enter your name, you cannot submit your work.
This feature is meant to limit inadvertent submissions.
Do **not** put your name on your work and pledge that the work is your own until you are ready to submit it.

The assessments also has [grading feedback](#grading-feedback) that gives you encouragement when you get correct answers.

The browser has autosave features that saves your work every five to ten minutes.

### {{!linkable_header('Games')}}

This semester will be doing gamification.
Please check the [agenda]({{get_url('root')}}#exam-review-/-game) for actual dates,
but the two games will be before each of the two midterms.

The web-based games will be in the form of multiple game segments.
Each game segment will be a few short, word-based questions that requires a SQL query or other answer.
Immediately after submitting one segment, the next segment will appear.
Because of the automatic moving to the next segment, [subsequent submissions](#subsequent-submissions) are not accepted for games.

Gamification is such that **a portion of the class**, will receive bonus points for different criteria.
For example, a portion of the class with the shortest time between getting and submitting a correct game segment will receive a bonus.
You must get all questions correct to be eligible for a game bonus.
Each student can receive at most one bonus per game.

For example, let's assume a student has a hard time with the first game segment and takes a long time to answer.
No problem!!!
For the second game segment each students gets a newly reset clock.
So given multiple game segments there are multiple possibilities for bonus points.

Games will be very similar to worksheets in that the [grading-feedback](#grading-feedback)'s
green-light confirmation will be given for correct game answers.
For any game segment submitted during class, the minimum grade is 50%.
For any game segment submitted during class correctly answering 75% or better of the questions will receive a score of 100%.
I hope you see games as a fun, low-stakes way to show your mastery of the material.

Similar to in-class worksheets, games are done in-class.
Neither late nor [subsequent submissions](#subsequent-submissions) will be accepted.

### {{!linkable_header('Worksheets')}}

Web-based worksheets are a way to reward coming to class, coming to class prepared, and for class participation.
For any worksheet submitted on-time, scores of 75% or better will receive a score of 100%.
For any worksheet submitted on-time, the minimum grade is 50%.

For the in-class or pre-class worksheets, handing them in on time does require being prepared.
Generally, [subsequent submissions](#subsequent-submissions) will **not** be accepted for in-class worksheets.



<!--
As this is a computer grading system, it is somewhat difficult to _unsubmit_ a worksheet or any assignment.
You will be given grace on any two assignments that you want to unsubmit before the due time.
But you should consider that only the first submission of all assignments will be the one craded.
-->

Lastly, there are [worksheet bonuses](#worksheet-bonus)
(see [grading criteria](#grading-criteria)).
Therefore I hope you see worksheets as a low-stakes bonus for coming to class prepared.


### {{!linkable_header('Homework assignments')}}

There will be five Python homework assignments that allow demonstration of knowledge of the material.
In general, two homeworks will be due before midterm one;
two will be due before midterm two;
and one will be due before the final exam.
Unfortunately, if you have some emergency that is totally out of your control, 
please contact me as soon as possible because once the grader is run and answers are generally available, no late submissions will be accepted.

My rule on extensions is an extension that is requested less than 24 hours before an assessment due time,
the request will **not** be granted.

Per the section on [Python]({{get_url('syllabi', page_name='syllabus')}}#anaconda-/-python-/-sqlite3),
homeworks will be done using Anaconda's Jupyter notebooks running Python.
After you have installed Anaconda, you can verify your installation with
a [demo assignment]({{static('images/A0.zip')}}) which will not be graded.
Note that wherever you download the demo assignment, it must be in the file tree that `jupyter notebook` was started in.

For a homework that doesn't get graded as 100%, a subsequent submissions
can be made to get a 100%.
But each subsequent submission is weighted / worth less toward your overall homework score.
See [subsequent submissions](#subsequent-submissions) for more information submission weighting.
Subsequent submissions can only be done **after** the grader has identified incorrect answers.


#### {{!linkable_header('Anaconda / Python /sqlite3')}}

Homeworks will be done using [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks.

For those who have very little experience with Python,
I would recommend _looking_ at the code in [tutorialspoint's SQLite -Python tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_python.htm) or some other tutorial of your choosing.
The amount of Python programming will be limited to querying the database,
printing data,
reading/writing files, etc.
Since this will be done as part of homeworks,
you will have ample time to pick up Python as-you-go.

You may want to install [Anaconda's free Individual Edition](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
to play with Jupyter notebooks before the first homework assignment.
The [downloads page](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads) has 32- and 64-Bit 
installers.
I highly recommend you use the same version of Python to avoid potential problems.
You can verify if you have the same Python version by typing `python --version`
and getting the output `Python 3.10.12`.

If you have any problems installing the software, please schedule time with one of the LAs during 
office hours
(see the [help page]({{get_url('syllabi', page_name='help')}}).)


### {{!linkable_header('Exams')}}

The largest portion of your grade will be the two web-based midterms and final exam.
Given that there is [grading feedback](#grading-feedback),
there is no traditional partial credit on exams.

For midterms and final exam you will be allowed to bring in:<ul>
 <li> One 8.5 x 11 inches sheet of handwritten notes, both sides<ul>
   <li> All notes **must** be handwritten </li>
   <li> **NO** computer output </li></ul>
 <li> Your personal computer running Chrome<ul>
   <li> No other webpages open </li>
   <li> No other internet capable devices, no internet capable calculators </li>
   <li> This means no phones, no headphones </li></ul>
 </ul>  

Similar to homeworks, after the exam has been graded and incorrect answers identified,
a subsequent submission can be made.
See [subsequent submissions](#subsequent-submissions) for more information submission weighting.
In general, exams will be graded the same day and subsequent submissions will be 
**limited to the end of the next day**.

See [Key Dates](#key-dates)  and [Grading Criteria](#grading-criteria) for more information.

<!--
As this is a computer grading system, it is somewhat difficult to _unsubmit_ an exam or any assignment.
You will be given grace on any two assignments that you want to unsubmit.
But you should consider that only the first submission of any assignment will be graded.

Total &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{{total_percentage}}%

### {{!linkable_header('Subsequent Submissions')}}

Think of subsequent submissions as a way to get partial credit on take-home worksheets, homeworks, and midterms.
After submitting an assessment, it is possible to make a subsequent submission after the grader has been run.
Each subsequent submission is incrementally weighted less than the previous submissions and
must have a greater score than all previous submissions to improve the overall assessment score.
There is a limit of ten (10) submissions for each assessment.
Subsequent submissions are not available for games and the final exam.
(Please not the original syllabus said that in-class worksheets were not available
for subsequent submissions, but after a class discussion, they are now available for subsequent submission.)

For midterms, the grader is not run until all students have taken the midterm
which with [midterm makeups]({{get_url('syllabi', page_name='syllabus')}}#midterm-makeups) could be as late as 4:00 PM the day following the midterm.
Subsequent submissions **are not** available until after the grader has been run against the original submission.

**NOTE:** The original syllabus had a time limit of 48 hours after midterms.
After a class discussion, this was changed.
Subsequent submissions are accepted for midterms until midnight (11:59:59 PM) two weeks
after the midterm.  For midterm 1 on Oct 3rd, subsequent submissions must be completed
by 11:59:59 PM Oct 17th.  Similar scheduling for midterm 1.

Homeworks and worksheets can be subsequently submitted up to Dec 5th, 11:59:59 PM.

**There are no subsequent submissions on the final exam!**

As an example, assume a homework's first submission is 75%.
The grade for the assessment could be improved by a subsequent submission of 100%.
But the second submission will only add (100%-75%)/2 or 12.5% for an overall assessment value of 87.5%.

In general the overall score of an assessment with $n$ submissions in a Python list $P$:

Overall_score = $P[0] +$
$\frac{max(0, P[1] - max(P[:1]))}{2} +$
$\frac{max(0, P[2] - max(P[:2]))}{3} +$
$\dots +$ 
$\frac{max(0, P[n-1] - max(P[:n-1]))}{n}$

As an example, assume an exam is submitted in class,
the grader runs that evening,
and the initial grade is 60%.
Before the submission deadline, assume subsequent submissions of 40%, 80% then 100% are made.
The Python list of scores is $P = [60, 40, 80, 100]$.

overall_score = $P[0] +$
$\frac{max(0, P[1] - max(P[:1]))}{2} +$
$\frac{max(0, P[2] - max(P[:2]))}{3} +$
$\frac{max(0, P[3] - max(P[:3]))}{4}$  
overall_score = $60 +$
$\frac{max(0, 40 - max([60]))}{2} +$
$\frac{max(0, 80 - max(P[60, 40]))}{3} +$
$\frac{max(0, 100 - max(P[60, 40, 80]))}{4}$  
overall_score = $60 + \frac{0}{2} + \frac{20}{3} + \frac{20}{4} = 71.7$

### {{!linkable_header('Grade rounding')}}

Note that the total percentage for the class assessments is more than 100%.
There is a total of 101% for the class.
Therefore there is no grade rounding.
A 94.9 is an A-.
Technically a 94.9 out of 101 is a 93.9.
If you truly want to round your grade up, 
attend class regularly, hand in worksheets on-time,
plan to have time after homeworks and exams for resubmissions,
and participate in class to get [worksheet bonuses](#worksheet-bonus).
Regular attendance, class participation, and on-time submissions,
not grade grubbing, should be used to improve your grade.

### {{!linkable_header('Midterm makeups')}}

Also there will be **no makeup midterms** after 4:00 PM the day following a midterm.
If you miss a test with a Dean's excuse, a medical diagnosis of an illness, or an instructor approved absence
you may complete the test **before** 4:00 PM the day following the test.
If you miss a test with a Dean's excuse, medical diagnosis of an illness,
or an instructor approved absence
but cannot make up the test before 4:00 PM the day following a test,
the weight of the next midterm or final exam will simply be
increased by the weight of the missed midterm.
If you miss a midterm without an excuse, you receive a zero for the test.

The course final is given in compliance with UNC final exam regulations and
according to the UNC [Final Exam calendar](https://registrar.unc.edu/academic-calendar/final-examination-schedule-fall/).



## {{!linkable_header('Grading Feedback')}}

You will get instant feedback on the correctness of your most of your answers.
The Chrome browser will change input boxes <font color="green">green</font> to indicate correctness.
<font color="green">Green</font> highlight should just assist you.

During an exam, if you believe your answer is correct and the input box did not turn <font color="green">green</font>,
continue on.
During homeworks or worksheets, if you believe your answer is correct and the input box did not turn <font color="green">green</font>,
go to [office hours]({{get_url('syllabi', page_name='help')}}).

Note that single, HTML-select pull-downs are simply multiple choice questions.
There is no instant feedback on multiple choice questions.

My computer and I will do all grading.
The teaching assistants' sole function is helping you learn. 
So please don't complain to them if you have a problem with the grade.
Bring all grading issues first to the assistants to get clarification,
if you still believe the grade is wrong then bring the issue to me.
Final feedback will be available on the [feedback page]({{get_url('feedback')}}),
and correct answers will be available on the [feedback page]({{get_url('feedback')}}).
No traditional partial credit will be given.
No late assignments will be accepted after grading/answers are generally available.

All scores on worksheets, homeworks, and exams will be normalized to percentages and then averaged.
In other words, homework 1 might have 100 points and homework 2 might have 110 points, 
but they are normalized to percentages and averaged together to get the homework points that contribute to your numeric total points.
Numeric total points will be translated to letter grades with the following ranges.
Note that a 94.9999 is less than a 95;
don't assume anything will be rounded (see [grade rounding](#grade-rounding)).

<style>pre,code { background-color: white; font-size: 1em; }</style>
```text
90  ≤ A- < 95    95  ≤ A  ≤ {{total_percentage}}
80  ≤ B- < 83⅓   83⅓ ≤ B  < 86⅔  86⅔ ≤ B+ < 90
70  ≤ C- < 73⅓   73⅓ ≤ C  < 76⅔  76⅔ ≤ C+ < 80
                 60  ≤ D  < 65   65  ≤ D+ < 70
                       F  < 60
```

### {{!linkable_header('Worksheet bonus')}}
For insightful raised hand / answered question in class or 
for each insightful [Piazza post marked as a good notes](#piazza),
a worksheet bonus of up to 50% will be added to the lowest worksheet score. 
An email confirmation will be sent of each worksheet bonus given and the bonus will be reflected on the [grades page]({{get_url('grades')}}).
Please see [section Piazza](#piazza) for more information on what is a good [Piazza]({{PIAZZA}}) post.

Note that although bonuses for good [Piazza]({{PIAZZA}}) posts are for correct, helpful posts, bonuses for answering questions (correctly or incorrectly) in class. The bonus is given when the instructor feels an honest attempt was made to answer the question, participate in class, or help other students on [Piazza]({{PIAZZA}}).

If you feel you should have received a bonus, please bring it to the instructor's or assistants' attention as soon as possible.
Realize that there are approximately 100 students, so please notify me via email within one week from when the bonus should have been received.
As an Easter egg for reading the syllabus before class starts, if you fill out the [demo worksheet]({{get_url('worksheets', key='worksheet-00-demo')}}) before 8:00 AM the first day of class, you will receive a worksheet bonus.

Lastly, the instructors will do their best to round-robin who gets called on in class. But understand there are hundreds of students and this is a best attempt.

Bonuses are meant to encourage and reward participation in class and [Piazza]({{PIAZZA}}).


## {{!linkable_header('Piazza')}}

[Piazza]({{PIAZZA}}) is a great place to have a discussion about a subject from class.
You will need to sign up (use access code `{{PIAZZA_ACCESS_CODE}}`) and check it regularly.
Here are some tips to create good piazza posts.
You may want to watch [this cute video](https://youtu.be/tVqWcrMPxfY) on why it's good to post well.

 - Why?  To teach one another
 - Post early
 - Read others posts before making your own
 - Write clearly and concisely
 - Refer to others posts.  Use a URL hyperlink where possible.
 - Explain why.  Don't just state something that you believe is obvious.
 - Be respectful.  Say what you mean without being mean!

The COMP 421 Piazza site is [here]({{PIAZZA}}) with a access code is `{{PIAZZA_ACCESS_CODE}}`.

## {{!linkable_header('How to succeed in this course')}}

Regardless of your definition of success,
I hope you succeed in this course.
Whether success means a good grade or being prepared for that job interview question,
I have found that there are three things that increase the chances of success in the class.

1. Come to class prepared:  
You should have completed the reading assignments from the [agenda]({{get_url('root')}}#agenda)
before coming to class.
This does not mean to read for complete understanding.
It does mean to read to understand the high level concepts.
Coming to class knowing what you don't know is an advantage.
You will able ask intelligent questions.

2. Don't fall behind:  
After reading and covering a subject in class, if you don't understand the material,
get help at [office hours]({{get_url('syllabi', page_name='help')}}) early.
There are much shorter lines and there will be more time to discuss things more thoroughly.
Waiting until just before the midterm to get help is just problematic.

3. Be formal and precise:  
Read questions, answer questions, and check your work;
you need to do all three.
Please embrace the mathematical notation.
Be precise with your answers.


Please visit the [reading assignments page]({{get_url('syllabi', page_name='reading')}}) soon.

## {{!linkable_header('Course Policies and Honor Code')}}

Before my course policy, this is my life policy:
I assume my mother's watching me.
Whether that's in the classroom, at the meeting, in the discussion, or at the grocery store.
How would my mother perceive my behavior?
Therefore when you argue a point, ask a question, or whatever, just assume that someone you love and respect is listening to you.
You want them to be proud and not embarrassed by your behavior.
Please call me out when you perceive I have strayed from this policy.
My mother will appreciate it as I fail often and she needs the help!

For this class, my policy is Be Prepared.
(See [How to succeed in this course](#how-to-succeed-in-this-course) for more information.)
Because, as a practical matter, we can't always be prepared, when you aren't prepared just own it.
Ask for help as soon as you start to fall behind.
Then catch up, regroup, and come prepared the next time.

#### {{!linkable_header('Honor Code')}}

As in life, collaboration is encouraged on homeworks.
Of course, whatever you hand in must be your own writing/typing.
Since midterms and the final exam will test whether you understand the homework assignments,
no collaboration of any kind is allowed.
So you violate the honor code and do yourself a disservice if you just copy the answers on homeworks, the midterms, or exams.

Examples of using Google&reg;/Stack Overflow&reg;/ChatGpt&reg; for collaboration on homeworks and worksheets
(never on midterms and exams!) would be to further understand the question,
to understand how to structure an answer,
or to see another's way of attacking a problem.
Copying code is prohibited!
Cutting and pasting code from sources outside of the COMP 421 website is prohibited.
Collaboration implies getting help and then **writing the code yourself!**

Regardless of where the collaboration came from, acknowledge the collaboration on the worksheet or homework honor code pledge!

Examples of violations of the honor code are below.
Of course, these are not the only violations, but over the years students have questioned what is a violation and this list is helpful for a good understanding of what is a violation of the honor code.

 - Giving students answers, especially on exams but also on worksheets and  homeworks.
For example, posting the answers directly or indirectly on Piazza, Discord,      GroupMe or other bulletin boards.
This is not collaboration!

#### {{!linkable_header('Attendance Policy')}}


No right or privilege exists that permits a student to be absent from any class meetings, except for these University Approved Absences:  
 1. Authorized University activities  
 2. Disability/religious observance/pregnancy, as required by law and approved by [Accessibility Resources and Service](https://ars.unc.edu/)    and/or the [Equal Opportunity and Compliance Office (EOC)](https://ars.unc.edu/)  
 3. Significant health condition and/or personal/family emergency as approved by the [Office of the Dean of Students](https://odos.unc.edu/),    [Gender Violence Service Coordinators](https://womenscenter.unc.edu/resources/gender-violence-services/), and/or the [Equal Opportunity and      Compliance Office (EOC)](https://eoc.unc.edu/what-we-do/accommodations/).

I will **NOT** formally be taking attendance.
But I can track your attendance because of the in-class worksheets.
This is due to the fact that in order to submit in-class worksheets,
they have to be submitted during the in-class activity.
For example, a worksheet given at the start of lecture will
have it's _submit button_ removed so that those who come late
will be unable to submit the work.
Some classes will have two or three in-class worksheets / activities and
all will only be accepted for credit during the activity.
This is an indirect way attendance can be tracked.


Therefore, attending class in-person is imperative to your success
(see [How to succeed in this class](#how-to-succeed-in-this-class)).
Please communicate with me early about potential absences so that adjustments can be made to in-class activities.
Please be aware that you are bound by the [Honor Code](http://catalog.unc.edu/policies-procedures/honor-code/) when making a request for a       University approved absence.
Even requests for absences for unapproved absences like job interviews, club activities, etc are bound by the Honor Code.
 


## {{!linkable_header('Accommodations, Resources, and Services')}}

Academic accommodations and associated resources and services
are designed to provide equal access to courses and programs.
Accommodations are evaluated and granted individually based on
the functional limitations  specified in the documentation
submitted by the students.

[Accessibility Resources and Service](https://ars@unc.edu) receives requests for accommodations, and through the Student and Applicant Accommodations Policy determines eligibility and identifies reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities and/or chronic medical conditions to mitigate or remove the barriers experienced in accessing University courses, programs and activities.

ARS also offers its Testing Center resources to students and instructors to facilitate the implementation of testing accommodations.

Faculty and instructors with any concerns or questions about accommodations and/or their implementation, are invited to reach out to ARS to discuss.

For more information see the [Accessibility Resources and Service website](https://ars.unc.edu/accommodations).
