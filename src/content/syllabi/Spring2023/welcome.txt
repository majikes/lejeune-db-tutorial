Welcome to COMP 421 databases and files. In this class, you'll be learning databases,
file storage, system structures and in their design.

We will be using Database Management Systems, Third Edition by Ramakrishnan.
The first three chapters are pretty, good and easy reads.
Please skip the discussion about UML.  UML is an old language that, in my opinion, has fallen out of favor.

The first six chapters will be on the first midterm.   The next six or seven will be on the second midterm.
One of the things I am changing for this class, is that you be able to drop one of the two midterms.
Read the syllabus for more details.

There is an Easter egg in the syllabus.  Did you find it?

We will be homeworks in Python, which was the process, I think, in the last few years.
The programs are going to be very small and the syllabus has a recommendation for downloading Python and learning how to code in it.
But hopefully learning Python will be very trivial for you.

Also, on the classes before the midterm we will be doing SQL gamification.
Think of it as a cross between Jeopardy and escape rooms.
The details of the games will be discussed and ironed out in the first two classes.
But hopefully this will be fun and educational.

So a little bit about myself, I've spent about 35 years in industry and worked for large corporations and startups.
I've been responsible for hundreds of millions of dollars of annual revenue.
And I've had 100+ developers reporting to me and I'd be responsible for tens of thousands of lines of code.

Late in my career, I decided to go back and get my Ph.D. and now I have my dream job.

So stop by my office sometime, introduce yourself.
Having been in industry for awhile, I can do mock interviews if you want to schedule one.
But come by the office and we'll talk about databases or whatever.
But welcome to databases!
